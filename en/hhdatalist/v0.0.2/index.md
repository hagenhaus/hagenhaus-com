# HHDataList

Goal is to be able to explain everything about HHDataList by referring to diagrams on the website.

Define method, endpoint, operation, and API here.

Put a video here.

List current limitations:

1. Limited i18n support.

Add table with all the theme names. Put creator name next to theme name.

I need to identify and publish metrics like number of integrations.
