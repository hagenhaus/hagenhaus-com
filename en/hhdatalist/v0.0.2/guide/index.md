# User Interface

The HHDataList user interface is divided into four rows, and the Tabs Row is divided into five tabs. Note that the Tabs row appears above the other three rows which remain visible as the user clicks from tab to tab:

# Record Creation Mode

This section describes the three ways that HHDataList creates expanded records.

## Copy Mode

In *Copy* mode, HHDataList copies field names and values from an API response record to an HHDataList expanded record without excluding or reordering any fields. The expanded record is called a *copied* record. Each field is called a *copied* field.

## Manage Mode

In *Manage* mode, HHDataList copies (from the API response record to the HHDataList expanded record) only fields specified in the `options.fieldDefinitions.manage` array. HHDataList also orders the copied fields according to the order of the fields in the array. HHDataList does not, however, merge fields, alias field names, nor transform field values. The expanded record is called a *managed* record. Each field is called a *managed* field.

## Transform Mode

In *Transform* mode, HHDataList copies (from the API response record to the HHDataList expanded record) only fields specified in the `options.fieldDefinitions.transform` array. HHDataList also orders the copied fields according to the order of the fields in the array. HHDataList may also merge fields, alias field names, and/or transform field values. The expanded record is called a *transformed* record. Each field is called a *transformed* field.
