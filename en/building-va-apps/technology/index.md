These pages explore the technology that supports the [US Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/), one of [15 departments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments) within the Executive Branch of the US Federal Government. With 377,805 employees (2020) and a $112.2 billion budget (2022), the VA mission is to care for those *who shall have borne the battle* and for their families, caregivers and survivors.

The VA includes the [Office of Information and Technology](https://digital.va.gov/office-of-information-and-technology/) (OIT) which is guided by the following statements:

* Vision Statement: To become a world-class organization that provides a seamless, unified Veteran experience through the delivery of state-of-the-art technology. See also [Vision for Digital Transformation](https://digital.va.gov/digital-transformation/).

* Mission Statement: To collaborate with business partners to create the best experience for all Veterans.
